Leading a small team, I directed the development lifecycle—delegating tasks, designing levels, and setting up bug reporting workflows. This project gave me my first real look at managing 'scope creep' and the importance of a disciplined workflow. To keep our development stable, I implemented Git branching strategies to handle team collaboration and integration as the project scaled.",

          <p>
            I’m a Computer Science student at Texas A&M pursuing a minor in Business.
            I enjoy building full-stack applications and learning technologies by applying them to real problems.
            Recently, I’ve been experimenting with AI techniques like LoRA fine-tuning to better understand how modern AI systems are trained and integrated into software.
            I’m currently seeking Software Engineering internship opportunities for Summer 2026.
